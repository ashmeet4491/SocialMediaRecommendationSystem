Social media has been building up a vast network of connections between people around the world. Optimization is building this network with minimum and 
nearest connections available and give a better and simple user experience to people.

Our main aim is to focus on building up a system which is not only based on mutual connections but also on common hobbies and interests.
 Our project deals with matching the similar thoughts and likings of the people and connect them through that path. We have been able to move
 forward with this idea and come up with the connections on the basis of common likings.
 
Social media helps one user to know another user by suggesting them to be friends via their common friends.
->The recommendation system used only the common connections to suggest friends, without clearly mentioning the algorithms on web.
->There can be improvements in this system by establishing a stronger connection by matching the interests of the people.


Implementation of code in the following phases:
Count of total number of rows and columns
Read the data from the dataset where we are showing the connections between persons
Make a adjacency matrix where distance is mentioned (adjacent or one hop away)
Read the interests from another dataset and store in structure
Find the weights of a given person to another which is one hop away and compare the interests


Algorithm-
Step 1: Start
Step 5: Read and export the data row wise from the csv file to c
Step 6: Store and display the graph for the read data
Step 7: Read the data which is separated by commas and store them in individual arrays
Step 8: Assign the weights to the edges by checking according to the conditions
	8.1 Print the row wise data
Step 9: Compare the data of one row with all the other rows
	9.1 Display the friend suggestion
Step 10: Check for the condition for the closest friend
	10.1 Display the closest friend
Step 11: Check for the one hop away nodes
	11.1 Display the similarities
